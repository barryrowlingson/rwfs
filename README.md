rwfs
====

WFS, or Web Feature Service, is a standard for clients to retrieve
geographic feature information - points, lines and polygons with 
attribute data - over the network.

This package will enable spatial R objects to be read and mapped by 
any GIS package that implements the client side of the WFS protocol.
Specifically it means that you can use Quantum GIS to map spatial data
in R without having to export from R and import to QGIS
or do any other conversion.
